The `strcode` (short for structuring code) package contains tools to organize
and abstract your code better. It consists of

- An [RStudio Add-in](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) that lets you 
  quickly add code block separators and titles (possibly with unique 
  identifiers) to divide your work into sections.
  The titles are recognized as sections by RStudio, which enhances the coding
  experience further.
- A function `sum_str` that summarizes the code structure based on the 
  separators and their comments added with the Add-in. For one or more files,
  it can cat the structure to the console or a file.
- An [RStudio Add-in](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) that lets you
  insert a code anchor, that is, a hash sequence which can be used to uniquely 
  identify a line in a large code base.

<!-- You can learn more about structuring code in [Bono Usu](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/bonousu/blob/devel/docs/commenting-code.html), 
a guide for good practice in R programming. -->

```{r, out.width = "650px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorenzwalthert/strcode/master/demos/strcode_v0.2.0_video_to_gif2_large.gif")
```


# Installation
You can install the package from GitHub.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lorenzwalthert/strcode")
```

# Structuring code
We suggest three levels of granularity for code structuring, whereas
higher-level blocks can contain lower-level blocks.

- level 1 sections, which are high-level blocks that can be 
  separated as follows:
```{r}
#   ____________________________________________________________________________
#   A title                                                                 ####
```

- level 2 sections, which are medium-level blocks that can be 
  separated as follows:
```{r}
##  ............................................................................
##  A subtitle                                                              ####
```

- level 3 sections, which are low-level blocks that can be 
  separated as follows:
```{r}
### .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
### One more                                                                ####
```


You can notice from the above that

* The number of `#` used in front of the break character (`___`, `...`, `. .`) 
  corresponds to the level of granularity that is separated.
* The breaks characters `___`, `...`, `. .` were chosen such that they reflect 
  the level of granularity, namely `___` has a much higher visual density than 
  `. .`. 
* Each block has an (optional) short title on what that block is about.
* Every title ends with `####`. Therefore, the titles are recognized 
  by RStudio as [sections](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200484568-Code-Folding-and-Sections).
  This has the advantages that you can get a quick summary of your code 
  in Rstudio's code pane and you can fold sections as you can fold 
  code or function declarations or if statements. See the pictures below for 
  details.
  
The separators all have length 80. The value is looked up in the global 
option `strcode$char_length` and can therefore be changed by the user.

By default, breaks and titles are inserted via a Shiny Gadget, but this 
default can be overridden by setting the option `strcode$insert_with_shiny` 
to `FALSE` and hence only inserting the break.

# Anchoring sections
Sometimes it is required to refer to a code section, which can be done by title.
A better way, however, is to use a unique hash sequence - let us call it a 
code anchor - to create an arguably unique reference to that section. 
A code anchor in `strcode` is enclosed by `#<` and `>#` so all anchors can 
be found using regular expressions. You can add section breaks 
that include a hash. That might look like this
```{r}
##  .................. #< 685c967d4e78477623b861d533d0937a ># ..................
##  An anchored section                                                     ####
```

# Insert a code anchor
Code anchors might prove helpful in other situations where one want to anchor a 
single line. That is also possible with `strcode`.
An example of a code anchor is the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#< 56f5139874167f4f5635b42c37fd6594 >#
this_is_a_super_important_but_hard_to_describe_line_so_let_me_anchor_it
```
The hash sequences in strcode are produced with the R package 
[digest](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/digest).

# Summarizing code
Once code has been structured by adding sections (as above), it can easily be 
summarized or represented in a compact and abstract form. This is particularly 
handy when the codebase is large, when a lot of people work on the code or when 
new people join a project. The function `sum_str` is designed for the purpose of 
extracting separators and respective comments, in order to provide high level 
code summaries. It is highly customizable and flexible, with a host of options. 
Thanks to RStudio's API, you can even create summaries of the file you are working on,
simply by typing `sum_str()` in the console. The file presented in the example 
section below can be summarized as follows:

```{r}
sum_str(path_in = "placeholder_code/example.R", 
        file_out = "",
        width = 40,
        granularity = 2,
        lowest_sep = FALSE, 
        header = TRUE)
```

- `path_in` specifies a directory or filenames for looking for content to
  summarize.
- `file_out` indicates where to dump the output.
- `width` gives the width of the output in characters.
- `granularity = 2`indicates that we want two of three levels of granularity
  to be contained in the summary and don't include level 3 comments.
- Similarly, we use `lowest_sep = FALSE` to indicate that we want lowest 
  separators (given `granularity`) to be omitted between the titles of the 
  sections.
- `header` was set to `TRUE`, so the column names were reported as well. Note 
  that they are slightly off since knitr uses a different tab length. In the R
  console and more imporantly in the outputed file, they are aliged.


## Example of improved legibility
To demonstrate the improvement in legibility, we give an extended example with 
some placeholder code.
